resume for how to write and publish to npm

(Make sure you have typescript dependencies installed)

1. npm init --scope=@my-scope or npm init --scope=@your-company-name
2. Modifications package.json
- change value in main to "main": "dist/index.js"
- change or add value in types to "types": "dist/index.d.ts"
- change or add value in files to "files" : ["/dist"]
3. npx tsc --init or tsc --init
4. Modifications tsconfig.json

-- like this --
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "es2016",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "noimplicitany": true,
    "declaration": true,

  },
  "include": ["src/**/*"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}

5. Create source folder (src)
6. Create folder with name your package into src folder
7. Create index.ts file in your package folder (for export all your function in your package folder)
8. Create index.ts file in src folder (root folder of src, for export all any in your package folder)
9. Compiled your package folder to dist folder (typescript into javascript with npx tsc or tsc)

=== Preparing for publish your package into npm ===
10. Make sure you are logged in (npm login)
11. Now you can publish your package into npm with (npm publish)

Note :
If you are get the error like this:
402 Payment Required - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/@yadiganteng32%2faritmetic-operators - You must sign up for private packages

Because at the time you publish your package, it is private publish
So you need to change your package to public publish with (npm publish --access public)

And Congratulations, your package is published into npm ðŸ¤©
